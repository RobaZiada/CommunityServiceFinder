# CommunityServiceFinder
Community Service Finder App
**Vision**: To create an app that connects volunteers with nearby community service opportunities based on their skills, location, and interests.
**Details**: Users would enter preferences and skills, and the app would show nearby service events, such as beach cleanups, tutoring, or charity events. This would promote community involvement and make it easy for people to find meaningful ways to contribute.
**Complexity**: Moderateâ€”could involve location services, a database for event listings, and filters based on user input.
